# ü©∫ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical features using machine learning. It performs classification and evaluates model performance with visual and statistical metrics.

## üìå Problem Statement

**Objective**:  
Predict the presence of heart disease using medical data.  

**Approach**:  
- Use a machine learning classifier (Random Forest)  
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score  
- Generate a confusion matrix heatmap

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset should be in CSV format. Each row represents a patient's medical records.

**Features:**
- `age`, `sex`, `cp`, `trestbps`, `chol`, `fbs`, `restecg`
- `thalach`, `exang`, `oldpeak`, `slope`, `ca`, `thal`
- `target` (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your CSV was converted from PDF, this script includes a cleaning function to handle misaligned columns.
